Examples described herein relate to a work scheduler that includes at least one processor and at least one queue. In some examples, the work scheduler receives a request to allocate a region of memory and based on availability of a memory segment associated with a central cache to satisfy the request to allocate a region of memory, provide a memory allocation using an available memory segment entry associated with the central cache from the at least one queue. In some examples, the work scheduler assigns a workload to a processor and controls when to pre-fetch content relevant to the workload to store in a cache or memory accessible to the processor based on a position of the workload in a work queue associated with the processor.
