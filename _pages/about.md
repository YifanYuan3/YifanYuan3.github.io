I'm Yifan (亦凡) Yuan (袁), and I recently joined [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html) as a research scientist.
Before that, I got PhD from [ECE@UIUC](https://ece.illinois.edu) (advised by [Prof. Nam Sung Kim](http://fast.ece.illinois.edu)). I'm interested in computer architecture and system, especially building modern data center networking with emerging hardware. 

Before joining UIUC in 2017, I spent three years on my undergraduate study at [Zhejiang University (ZJU)](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), focusing on computer architecture and VLSI design.

I grew up in [Tianjin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianjin), a city in China with spirit of humor and optimism. I enjoy badminton and swimming.
